# Finding Out Patterns of Attrition

Attrition of employees is a structural problem in many organisations. This has been getting worse over the years, due to a myriad of economic factors. 

In this data analysis, we explored attrition data of a company to find out patterns that might be related to why employees end up leaving, and which employees would have the most chance to leave in the future. In this way, we might find out broad patterns related to attrition, so we can change as an organisation to make employees more content at work.
